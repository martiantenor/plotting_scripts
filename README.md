# Plotting Scripts

These are a collection of scripts used for plotting data and performing associated tasks. For use primarily with the [Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) suite](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/plot.html), although a few scripts (e.g. "smallcircle_maker.py") are standalone programs.

Designed for Python 2.7, although only minor changes (e.g. `print()` statements) needed for 3.x conversion.
